Apocrypha are works, usually written works, that are of unknown authorship, or of doubtful origin. In the context of the Jewish and Christian Bibles, where most texts are of unknown authorship, Apocrypha usually is used by Protestants to refer to a set of texts included in the Septuagint and therefore included in the Catholic canon, but not in the Hebrew Bible.
