In computing, executable code or an executable file or executable program, sometimes simply an executable or binary, causes a computer "to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions," as opposed to a data file that must be parsed by a program to be meaningful. These instructions are traditionally machine code instructions for a physical CPU. However, in a more general sense, a file containing instructions  for a software interpreter may also be considered executable; even a scripting language source file may therefore be considered executable in this sense.
